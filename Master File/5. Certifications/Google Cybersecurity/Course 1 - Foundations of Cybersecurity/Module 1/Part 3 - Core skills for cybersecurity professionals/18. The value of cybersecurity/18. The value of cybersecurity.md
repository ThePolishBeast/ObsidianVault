# The value of cybersecurity

Now that you’ve learned about what cybersecurity is and how cybersecurity professionals protect people and organizations, it’s time to consider your own role in cybersecurity. Imagine that it’s your first day as a cybersecurity professional, and consider the following:

- What cybersecurity problems are you solving?
    
- How are you protecting your organization?
    
- How are you protecting people?
    
- What is the most exciting part about your day?
    

Please write one to two paragraphs (100-200 words) outlining your responses to the prompts. Then, visit the [discussion forums](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-cybersecurity/discussions) to read what other learners have written, and respond to at least two other posts with your own thoughts.
