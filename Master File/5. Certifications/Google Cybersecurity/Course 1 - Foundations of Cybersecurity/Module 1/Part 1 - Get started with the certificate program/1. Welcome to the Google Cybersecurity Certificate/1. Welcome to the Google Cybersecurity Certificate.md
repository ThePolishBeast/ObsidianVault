You may be wondering, 

what do security professionals actually do? 

Have you ever had to update your password 

online to include a number or a special symbol? 

If so, then you're already familiar with 

basic security measures, like password management. 

And if you've ever received a notification from 

a service provider about stolen data or a software hack, 

then you have first-hand experience 

with the impact of a security breach. 

If you've ever asked yourself

Security analysts help minimize 

risks to organizations and people. 

Analysts work to proactively guard against incidents 

while continuously monitoring systems and networks. 

And, if an incident does occur, 

they investigate and report their findings. 

They are always asking 

questions and looking for solutions.
