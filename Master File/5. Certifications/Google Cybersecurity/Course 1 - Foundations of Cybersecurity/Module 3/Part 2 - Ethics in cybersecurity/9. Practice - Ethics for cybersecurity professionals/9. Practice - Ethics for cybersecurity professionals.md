Ethical principles dictate that you follow the law as well as the standards and procedures established by your organization

2. **A doctor you work with claims to have laptop performance issues, so you try to identify the problem.**  
  
*As you’re working, you notice the doctor’s laptop has unsecured patient files visible on-screen instead of within the medical practice’s secure software.*

Unsecured patient files violate compliance standards, legal security ethics, and HIPAA regulations.

3. **You work for a medical device company as an entry-level security analyst.**  
  
*Your supervisor has asked you to securely dispose of old developer laptops, and tells you they may contain PII (personally identifiable information).*

Ethical standards dictate that PII data must be properly removed from decommissioned devices.
