# Your Course 1 learning journey

In this part of the program, you were introduced to how security protects organizations and people, and core skills and knowledge needed to become a cybersecurity analyst. Coming up, you’ll learn more about security domains, controls, frameworks, and compliance. You’ll also have an opportunity to analyze security information and event management (SIEM) data and use a playbook to respond to security incidents.

For this discussion prompt, consider the following: 

- What understandings and/or beliefs about cybersecurity did you have before starting this course?
    
- How have your understandings and/or beliefs about cybersecurity changed? 
    
- What’s an interesting element of the cybersecurity profession you discovered that you didn’t already know about?
    

Submit 3–4 sentences (60–80 words) responding to these questions. Then, visit the [discussion forums](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-cybersecurity/discussions) and, applying what you’ve learned, comment on at least two posts from other learners.
