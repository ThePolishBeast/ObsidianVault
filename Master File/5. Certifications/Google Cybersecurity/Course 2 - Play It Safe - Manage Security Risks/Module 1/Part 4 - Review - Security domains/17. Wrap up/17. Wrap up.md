You did a fantastic job adding new knowledge to your security analyst 

toolkit. 

In upcoming videos, we'll go into more detail about 

some common tools used by entry-level security analysts. 

Then, you'll have an opportunity to analyze data generated by those 

tools to identify risks, threats, or vulnerabilities. 

You'll also have a chance to use a playbook to respond to incidents. 

That's all for now. 

Keep up the great work!
