So far, you've learned about 

a variety of network protocols, 

including communication protocols like TCP/IP. 

Now we're going to go more in depth 

into a class of communication protocols 

called the IEEE802.11.

IEEE802.11, commonly known as Wi-Fi, 

is a set of standards that define 

communications for wireless LANs. 

IEEE stands for 

the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, 

which is an organization that maintains Wi-Fi standards, 

and 802.11 is a suite of 

protocols used in wireless communications.

Wi-Fi protocols have adapted 

over the years to become more secure and reliable 

to provide the same level of 

security as a wired connection. 

In 2004, 

a security protocol called the Wi-Fi Protected Access, 

or WPA, was introduced. 

WPA is a wireless security protocol 

for devices to connect to the internet. 

Since then, WPA has evolved 

into newer versions, like WPA2 and WPA3, 

which include further security improvements, 

like more advanced encryption. 

As a security analyst, 

you might be responsible for making sure that 

the wireless connections in your organization are secure. 

Let's learn more about security measures.
