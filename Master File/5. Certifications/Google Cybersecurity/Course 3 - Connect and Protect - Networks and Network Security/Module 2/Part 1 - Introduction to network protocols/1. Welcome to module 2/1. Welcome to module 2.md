Congratulations on the progress you've made so far! 

In this section, you'll learn about how 

networks operate using tools and protocols. 

These are the concepts that you'll use every 

day in your work as a security analyst. 

The tools and protocols you'll learn in this section of 

the program will help you protect 

your organization's network from attacks. 

Did you know that malicious actors can take advantage of 

data moving from one device to another on a network? 

Thankfully, there are tools and 

protocols to ensure the network 

stays protected against this type of threat.

As an example, I once identified an attack 

based solely on the fact they were 

using the wrong protocol. 

The network traffic volumes were right, and it 

was coming from a trusted IP, 

but it was on the wrong protocol, 

which tipped us off enough to shut down 

the attack before they caused real damage.

First, we'll discuss some common network protocols. 

Then we'll discuss virtual private networks, or VPNs. 

And finally, we'll learn about 

firewalls, security zones, and proxy servers. 

Now that you have an idea of where we're 

headed, let's get started.
