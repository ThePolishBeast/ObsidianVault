You've learned a lot about some complex topics. 

I want to congratulate you for coming this far in the program. 

Let's recap what we've covered in this section. 

First, we discussed common network protocols like TCP, ARP, HTTPS, and DNS. 

And then we covered how virtual private networks, or 

VPNs, can be used to maintain privacy on a public network. 

Finally, we explored how firewalls, security zones, and 

proxy servers help to secure network infrastructure.
