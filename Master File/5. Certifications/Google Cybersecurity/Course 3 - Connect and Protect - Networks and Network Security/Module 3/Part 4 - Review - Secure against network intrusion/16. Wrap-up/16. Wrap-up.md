Nice job finishing this section! 

Let's review what you've learned so far. 

We discussed how to secure networks. 

We also learned about network intrusion tactics 

like malicious packet sniffing and IP spoofing. 

Finally, we discussed how

You've learned about DoS and DDoS 

attacks like ICMP flooding, SYN attacks, 

and the ping of death, 

which try to overwhelming a network by 

flooding it with unwanted data packets.

Coming up, you'll learn 

about how security analysts can protect 

the network using various security hardening techniques.
