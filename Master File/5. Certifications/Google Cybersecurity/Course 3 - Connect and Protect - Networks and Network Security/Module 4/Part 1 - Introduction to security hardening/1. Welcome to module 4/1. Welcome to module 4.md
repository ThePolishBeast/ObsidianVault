I want to take a moment to congratulate you on your progress so far. 

First, you learned about network operations. 

Then, you learned about the tools and 

protocols that help network systems function. 

Next, you learned how vulnerabilities in 

networks expose them to various security intrusions.

Now, we'll discuss security hardening. 

Then, we'll learn about OS hardening, explore network hardening practices, and 

discuss cloud hardening practices. 

Security hardening can be implemented in devices, networks, 

applications, and cloud infrastructure. 

Security analysts may perform tasks, such as patch updates and 

backups, as part of security hardening.

We'll discuss these tasks as you progress through the course. 

As a security analyst, hardening will play a major role in your day-to-day tasks, 

which is why it's important for you to understand how it works. 

I'm excited to accompany you on this journey. 

Meet you in the next video.
