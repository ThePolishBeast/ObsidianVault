# Activity: Filter with grep

## Introduction

In this lab, you’ll learn how to use the grep command and piping to search for files and return specific information. You’ll get information from different files, including server log files and user data files. You’ll use Linux commands in the Bash shell to complete these steps. **Disclaimer:** For optimal performance and compatibility, it is recommended to use either **Google Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox** browsers while accessing the labs.

## What you’ll do

You have multiple tasks in this lab:

- Search for error messages in a file
    
- Search for files that contain a specific string
    
- Search for information in user files
