In this section, you learned 

about the Linux operating system. 

We examined the architecture of Linux. 

In our exploration of

discussed some of the most 

widely used distros in security. 

You were introduced to KALI LINUX™, Ubuntu, 

Parrot, Red Hat, and CentOS distributions. 

Finally, you learned about the shell and 

its role as an interpreter 

between the user and operating system.

Congratulations! You're doing 

great, and we have more useful topics to come. 

In the next part of the program,

the shell while working as 

a security analyst. Let's continue on.
