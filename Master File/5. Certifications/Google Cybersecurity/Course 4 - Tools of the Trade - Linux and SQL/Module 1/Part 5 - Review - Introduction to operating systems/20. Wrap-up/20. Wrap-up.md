We did it! 

What a great section of learning! 

The best thing is that we did this together and 

covered some very useful topics. 

Let's recap this section's lessons. 

As a security analyst, 

it's important that you understand the systems that you're working with. 

Understanding computer basics will help you do your job more effectively and 

efficiently. 

In this section, we covered common operating systems. 

We also discussed the main functions of an operating system. 

Importantly, you learned about the relationship between operating systems, 

applications, and hardware. 

It was nice to learn how they flow together like an orchestra. 

In addition, you learned about the differences between the graphical user 

interface and the command-line interface. 

Understanding the command-line interface will be very important for your work.

I enjoyed exploring the world of operating systems with you. 

Knowing how operating systems work is an important step in preparing for 

a position as a security analyst. 

You're doing great! 

Let's keep moving forward with this program. 

In the next section, 

we'll focus specifically on the Linux operating system.
