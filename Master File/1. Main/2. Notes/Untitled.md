While implementing a new system for logging and monitoring network activity to enhance security and detect any potential breaches.

I discovered that a senior executive was accessing sensitive data without proper authorization. This data included confidential employee information and financial records.

I had to decide whether to report the unauthorized access or ignore it. Most important to me is Integrity, Confidentiality, and Responsibility. In the end I decided to report the unauthorized access.

He was reprimanded and given additional training on the importance of data security and access protocols. This ultimately reinforced the company's employees security and ethical behavior
